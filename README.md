**Founder @ Purple Hedgehog AI**  
I build tools that give AI memory and structure â€” like Dadlas, a validation-first LLM dev tool, and the Layered Cognitive Mesh, a symbolic reasoning system.

 Areas I focus on:
- Token-efficient AI memory
- Symbolic reasoning systems
- Agent validation and behavior tracing
- DARPA-aligned research and development
