**Founder @ Purple Hedgehog AI**  
I build tools that give AI systems memory and structure — like Dadlas, a validation-first dev tool, and the Layered Cognitive Mesh, a symbolic reasoning framework

 Areas I focus on:
- Token-efficient AI memory
- Symbolic reasoning systems
- Agent validation and behavior tracing
- DARPA-aligned research and development

LLMs don't need more context — they need better memory
